# HideSiriSuggestions
Supports iOS 9 and 10.

Prevent apps from appearing in Siri Suggestions. Configure in the Settings app (General → Spotlight Search → Hide Apps).

From my testings it seems to be like this:

<ul>
<li>Hiding an app on iOS 9 results in another one appearing.</li>
<li>Hiding an app on iOS 10 results in an empty slot. I've tried to force iOS to fill the slot with the next most used app, but didn't find a way. Feel free to make a pull request if you find a way.</li>
</ul>
